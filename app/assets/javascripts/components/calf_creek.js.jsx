        <p>The CCH (6,000 - 5,800 BP) is an Early-Middle Archaic interval when
          foragers and bison hunters of the Southern Plains invested a great
          deal of time and skill in producing some of the more complex projectile
          points and notching technology in the archaeological record of
          North America.</p>

        <p>The Calf Creek, Andice, and Bell projectile points are associated
          with the CCH and have been found in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri,
          Oklahoma and Texas, and there is limited evidence in Colorado,
          New Mexico, northern Tamaulipas, and Utah.

      <p>At the terminus of the Early Archaic there was a climatic deviation,
        a cooling episode. This appears to have stimulated bison populations
        to venture further afield than normal (Lohse et. al 2015).
        The Calf Creek Horizon (CCH) is a cultural period that marks such a
        moment in time.  The CCH (6,000 - 5,800 BP) is an Early-Middle Archaic
        interval when foragers and bison hunters invested a great deal of time
        and skill in producing some of the more complex projectile points and
        notching technology in the archaeological record of North America.
        The Calf Creek, Andice, and Bell projectile points are associated
        with the CCH and have been found in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri,
        Oklahoma and Texas, and there is limited evidence in Colorado,
        New Mexico, northern Tamaulipas, and Utah.  Recently, rumors of Calf
        Creek points in the Dakotas have surfaced but scientific examination
        and confirmation by specialists has not occurred.  The accumulated site
        data for the CCH peoples since the 1950's indicates that the extraordinary
        projectile point technologies they created may have been a technological
        response to changes in ecology, similar to a Revitalization Movement
        that has been discussed and proposed in connection with Clovis technology,
        13,500 - 13,000 BP (Bradley & Collins 2012).

        The regions associated with the Calf Creek points are north of the
        Red River up to central Missouri but more widely includes Colorado,
        Kansas, and more densely in Oklahoma, while the Andice and Bell
        points are related point technologies that dominate today's Texas and
        northern Mexico region.  Current research by the author is exploring
        the western fringes of the CCH and supportive technological research
        is providing better resolution of the manufacturing behaviors of the
        social groups north and south of the Red River.  In this way it will
        be possible to shed light on a variety of questions such as where the
        technological ideas embedded in these point types began and which
        direction they spread, and what are the constellation of technological
        steps involved in these point types and how are they distinct or similar?
        Also, how much exchange and travel occurred across the geographic
        boundaries like the Rio Grande and Red River? Following the technological
        trail and the physical pathways that raw materials were transported,
        traded, and utilized throughout the southern Plains will help us
        understand the lifeways of the various social groups of this time and
        space within North America.

        Experimental replication work is another component of this research
        and a section of this website will host information related to ongoing
        replication studies.  The author is an experimental flint knapper and
        will be posting up-to-date experimental work that sheds light the Calf
        Creek Horizon point types and other point types in the archaeological
        record.  Stay tuned!</p>

          <p>Sergio is an archaeologist from the Gault School of
            Archaeological Research. His research focuses on
            lithic analysis and experimental knapping in order to
            conduct research regarding technological behaviors of
            prehistoric people.  Currently, he is working on the
            technological behaviors embedded in the production of the
            Calf Creek Horizon projectile point technologies
            (Andice, Bell and Calf Creek).</p>

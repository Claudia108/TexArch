        <p>The CCH (6,000 - 5,800 BP) is an Early-Middle Archaic interval when
          foragers and bison hunters of the Southern Plains invested a great
          deal of time and skill in producing some of the more complex projectile
          points and notching technology in the archaeological record of
          North America.</p>

        <p>The Calf Creek, Andice, and Bell projectile points are associated
          with the CCH and have been found in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri,
          Oklahoma and Texas, and there is limited evidence in Colorado,
          New Mexico, northern Tamaulipas, and Utah.<br>

          <p><b>The extensive flake debris (debitage) </b>that is a byproduct of making
            stone tools contains a great deal of information pertaining to the
            technological behaviors incorporated in any given lithic technology,
            whether it is highly complex or simple and 'generic'.</p>

          <p>For instance, in archaeological sites where CCH point types are
            found they are often found in association with notching flakes
            that are diagnostic flake debris that comes from specific indirect
            percussion techniques involved in their removal during manufacturing
            of new projectile points.  Such flakes are pictured here from
            the Gault Site.</p>
